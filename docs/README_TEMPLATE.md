5. **Images**: Store in `/docs/images/` or `/assets/`
6. **Badges**: Keep to 4-5 maximum, ensure they're meaningful
7. **Tables**: Use for comparing options or listing many items
8. **Emphasis**: Use **bold** for important points, *italic* for notes

## Required Files

Every project should also include:
- `LICENSE` - License file
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `.gitignore` - Ignore patterns
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

## Standard Header and Footer

**IMPORTANT**: All README files MUST include:

2. The philosophical footer quote with "Built with 💜 in the pursuit of infinite knowledge"

These elements establish consistent branding across all projects.

2. Major open source projects often have excellent READMEs:
   - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
   - [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
   - [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
