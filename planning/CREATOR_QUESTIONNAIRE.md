## üìã Questions & Responses

### üßë‚Äçüíª About You (The Creator)

- **Response**: The Grand Digital Architect

**2. What's your background?**
- General field: tech, design, research, multiple disciplines?
- **Response**: Currently in the military. Started with reading 100+ books in 2023, transitioned to military doctrine, then to language learning (Korean) when AI revolution began mid-2024. First used AI for ANKI flashcards in Google Sheets, then kept building more tools to stay current with AI capabilities. The journey feels like chasing something impossible to catch, yet persistence continues. "I don't know if language learning is the byproduct of my obsession to create more tools, or if engineering is the byproduct of language learning."

**3. What drives you?**
- Learning, building, sharing knowledge, solving problems?
- **Response**: Creating not only as a cloud repository but as a way to share creations and document the journey. Following in the footsteps of those before, adding to the relentless human pursuit of finding the point (the 1) of existence. This has led deeper into understanding what it means to create, forming a constant feedback loop of identifying as a creator.

### üí≠ The Why

**4. What sparked this GitHub directory project?**
- Was it frustration with finding good resources, desire to organize your work, wanting to help others?
- **Response**: It was an urge within that said, people need to see what I am creating. Even though the odds of people actually looking at what I am making may be low. The fact that I am able to release it and not keep it on my computer makes me feel like I at least attempting to give back. All it takes is to affect one person, then my job has been completed.

**5. What problem does this solve?**
- For you and potentially for others?
- **Response**: Will showcase projects for language learning, certifications, Notion templates, and any other AI-assisted tools created in this lifelong journey of knowledge acquisition and understanding (wisdom).

**6. What's your philosophy on open source/sharing knowledge?**

**8. What makes your collection unique?**
- Curated quality, specific focus area, innovative approaches?
- **Response**: The philosophical lens of wanting to go all gas no breaks on the journey towards information acquisition, while still giving back to the community. It's easier for people to see what I'm doing rather than having to stop and create products to show people what I am doing.

**9. Who's your intended audience?**
